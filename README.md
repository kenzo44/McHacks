## Inspiration

The covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health concerns and caused a work-from-home movement along with forcing counseling virtual. One tool championed by Dr. Russ Harris, the author of international best-seller *The Happiness Trap* is called **'The Choice Point'**. This tool provides a way to quickly identify the source of your biggest problems (and recognize what you are doing thatâ€™s making them worse) and plan how to deal with them effectively. It's a guide to reducing your suffering; a map to take your life in a meaningful direction.
